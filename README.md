# Data-Mining-with-Weka-TP-02
The idea was to find the popularity of the star wars franchise among people and the relation of this addiction to some other factors. it was hard to find reliable sources of data or surveys, however i was able to find a survey done by abc News on the 22 of July 2014. the survey had another aim, as it was searching for best Star Wars movies, least favourite (most hated) characters among Star Wars characters. The title of the survey was America’s Favorite ‘Star Wars’ Movies (And Least Favorite Characters) [8]. However I re-utilised the survey to use it for finding the relation between Star Wars fans and for example Gender,Age,Income,Education and many other factors.
